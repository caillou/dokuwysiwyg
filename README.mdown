DokuWysiwyg
===========

DokuWysiwyg is a wysiwyg editor for DokuWiki.

It is a JavaScript only port of the older [dokuwysiwyg Plugin][dokuwysiwyg] which heavily relied on Pearl.

The editor pretty much functions, yet there are two things to to:

1. Basic refactoring
--------------------

A lot of this code was written before I had any clue of JavaScript. And you can tell by looking at it.

2. Getting rid of the FCK editor
--------------------------------

The FCK editor that comes with this plugin is an old version that has been heavily hacked. It comes from the [dokuwysiwyg Plugin][dokuwysiwyg] Project. Hence, it can not be updated to the newest version. This should be replaced by a more modern and modular wysiwyg editor.
